## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of **Kernel Point Convolution** (KPConv) in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

KPConv is also available in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv) (original but older implementation).

Another implementation of KPConv is available in [PyTorch-Points-3D](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d)
 
KPConv is a point convolution operator presented in our ICCV2019 paper ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08889)). If you find our work useful in your

## Installation

This implementation has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10. Details are provided in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).


## Experiments

We provide scripts for three experiments: ModelNet40, S3DIS and SemanticKitti. The instructions to run these 
experiments are in the [doc](./doc) folder.

* [Object Classification](./doc/object_classification_guide.md): Instructions to train KP-CNN on an object classification
 task (Modelnet40).
 
* [Scene Segmentation](./doc/scene_segmentation_guide.md): Instructions to train KP-FCNN on a scene segmentation 
 task (S3DIS).
 
* [SLAM Segmentation](./doc/slam_segmentation_guide.md): Instructions to train KP-FCNN on a slam segmentation 
 task (SemanticKitti).
 
* [Pretrained models](./doc/pretrained_models_guide.md): We provide pretrained weights and instructions to load them.
 
* [Visualization scripts](./doc/visualization_guide.md): For now only one visualization script has been implemented: 
the kernel deformations display.
